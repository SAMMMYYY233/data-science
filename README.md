The aim of this project to predict the occurence of cardiovascular disease in patients based on their medical records. The project analyzes the patients medical records and medical history to calculate the probability of the occurence of cardiovascular disease in the patient.
# various stages involded
1. Importing libraries
2. Loading dataset
3. storing data into variable and printing
4. shape of data
5. counting null/empty values in data
6. visualization of data
7. sorting data
8. removing column
9. getting correlation between data
10. creating the Heatmaps
11. scaling data
12. Used random forest classifier
13. testing model accuracy on train and test data
14. Finally derving the model test accuracy(in my case it is 72.3%)
